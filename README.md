<h1> The Guild Almighty Homepage </h1>

<a href="https://guild.gh0start.com/">Live Site</a>

This web page was created as part of a challenge project from <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>.

The project directions were to create a homepage for a club or organization using responsive design elements for different screen sizes. 

I created a homepage for a fictional adventurers' guild based in a fantasy setting. The banner photo is sourced from Unsplash. The character art and logo are
designed/created by me.
