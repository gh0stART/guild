                        <p>Lyrei founded The Guild Almighty at age 237. At the time she had more than 100 year experience 
                            in adventuring, but had grown tired of wandering. Wishing to settle down, but not wanting to leave her city 
                            unprotected, she decided to gather names of nearby adventuring parties and together they became the Guild 
                            Almighty. Lyrei spends most of her days organizing quests for guild members, but she will still join a party 
                            on occasion, when the wanderlaust strikes her.</p>

                        <p>Ewenor was one of the original guild members sought out by Lyrei in the days of the guild's conception. 
                            The two has adventures together previously, and he had always been a trusted advisor. He has been an active participant 
                            in guild buisiness, from gathering leads on disturbances to scouting out locations before a party is sent. 
                            He is a valuable source of information to the travelling parties before they depart on their quests.</p>

                        <p>Although Solis joined The Guild Almighty only recently, she has proved herself to be a valuable member. Her skill demonstrated in 
                            the many quests she has undertaken has allowed her to scale the ranks quickly to become a member of the elite. As an officer, she 
                            assists both Lyrei and Ewenor in the day-to-day workings of the organization, but is still an active adventurer as well, taking on as 
                            many quests and her responibilites allow. </p>
